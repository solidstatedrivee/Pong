# Pong
A Brick Breaker type game that runs in Processing. It started out as Pong but I thought it would be fun to turn it into Brick Breaker as an added challenge. I fixed a lot of bugs and had a ton of fun making it! I learned a lot about the ArrayList class and even more about OOP. 

You can demo it [here!](https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/889858)
